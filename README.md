# Vampire Orchestra

### Introduction
<p>'Vampire Orchestra', created by Suebin Park(박수빈), is a shooting game where players can create their music with randomly generated piano key sounds.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Left/Right Key to move.</li>
  <li>Space Key to shoot</li>
  <li>Up/Down Key to change the shooting angle.</li>
</ol>

### Details
<p>
In this game, there is a vampire(=player) who collects gems and magic wands to create her/his music. There are two vampire characters, one of which will randomly chosen and later appear on the screen.<br>
Every time the player starts the game, six different piano key sounds are assigned to each gem. So it's like playing the piano that only has six piano keys. But remember: there are not only gems but also magic wands. When collided, they play musical instrument sounds randomly chosen from the list of drums, cymbals and cellos.<br>
  Except for six kinds of gems and other instruments, the note icon comes with only 3% possibility. If the vampire's axes hit the note icon, it leads the player to another screen. The player can listen to 'Ghost Choir' from Louis Zong. On this screen, she can dance with the bat using left&right keys. Bats on this screen are created by random sizes and random numbers from 1 to 4. I made their centerx, centery values change depending on the left&right keys, while choosing every time if the y value is positive/negative. This is to make the bats seem fluttering.<br>
  Plus, when the axes hit the sky, they don't disappear but fall by random direction as if there were gravity(even though it is still way different from the reality).
